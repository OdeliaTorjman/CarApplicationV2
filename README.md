CarApplication V2 is a viedeo game loved by all.
The game is about avoiding old men and catching the hearts that go down with time.

The application starts with a menu from which the user chooses whether to use the sensor mode or the arrow keys for guidance.
He also chooses whether he prefers normal or accelerated mode.

So he starts with 3 lives: one he loses by meeting the old man, and one he gains by meeting a heart.
When he's finished, the user is redirected to a window where he can enter his name to keep track of his score.

Finally, the top 10 scores are displayed in a new page with the name and location of each.
When you click on one of the scores displayed, the map automatically moves to its location.
